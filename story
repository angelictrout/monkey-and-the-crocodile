in the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife. 
 one day, the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. 
 the kind-hearted monkey offered him some fruits.
 the crocodile came back the next day for more fruits because he loved them.
 as days passed by the crocodile and the monkey became friends.
 one day, the monkey sent some fruits for the crocodile's wife. 
 she ate the fruits and liked them, but was jealous, as she didn't like her husband spending time with the monkey.
 she told her husband, "if the fruits are so juicy, i wonder how sweet the monkey's heart would be. Get me his heart."
 the crocodile was not willing to kill his friend but he had no choice.
